In the world of Domain Name System (DNS), TXT records are unique and versatile. They are used for various purposes like email verification, domain ownership validation, and custom metadata storage. This blog will explain what TXT records are, their role in DNS, and how to use them effectively.

## **1\. What Is a TXT Record?**

A **TXT Record** (Text Record) is a DNS record type that stores text data associated with a domain. It is commonly used to verify domain ownership, secure email delivery, and provide configuration information.

### **Key Points of TXT Records**

* **Text Storage:** Stores text data in a domain's DNS settings.
    
* **Flexible Usage:** Supports various verification, configuration, and informational purposes.
    
* **Multi-Purpose:** Can contain multiple values for different services.
    

### **Example of a TXT Record**

```plaintext
example.com.    IN  TXT   "v=spf1 include:mail.example.com ~all"
```

In this example:

* [`example.com`](http://example.com)`.`: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
    
* `IN`: Internet (DNS Class)
    
* `TXT`: Record Type
    
* `"v=spf1 include:`[`mail.example.com`](http://mail.example.com) `~all"`: SPF record for email security
    

### **How Does a TXT Record Work?**

1. **Service Request:** A service (e.g., email provider) requests the TXT record for verification or security purposes.
    
2. **DNS Lookup:** The DNS resolver queries the authoritative name server.
    
3. **TXT Record Resolution:** The authoritative name server returns the TXT record.
    
4. **Service Verification:** The requesting service reads and interprets the record.
    

## **2\. Common Uses of TXT Records**

### **a. SPF (Sender Policy Framework) Records**

SPF records prevent email spoofing by specifying which IP addresses or servers can send emails on behalf of your domain.

**Example SPF Record**

```plaintext
example.com.    IN  TXT   "v=spf1 include:mail.example.com ~all"
```

### **b. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) Records**

DKIM records are used to verify the authenticity of outgoing emails through digital signatures.

**Example DKIM Record**

```plaintext
default._domainkey.example.com.    IN  TXT   "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0..."
```

### **c. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) Records**

DMARC records provide guidelines for email receivers on how to handle emails that fail SPF and DKIM checks.

**Example DMARC Record**

```plaintext
_dmarc.example.com.    IN  TXT   "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@example.com"
```

### **d. Google Site Verification**

Google uses TXT records to verify domain ownership for its services.

**Example Google Site Verification Record**

```plaintext
example.com.    IN  TXT   "google-site-verification=abc123xyz456"
```

### **e. General Text Information**

TXT records can also be used to store arbitrary text information about a domain.

**Example Text Information Record**

```plaintext
example.com.    IN  TXT   "Organization=Example Corp; Location=USA"
```

## **3\. Adding or Modifying TXT Records**

### **Access DNS Settings**

* Log in to your DNS provider's dashboard.
    
* Navigate to the DNS management page.
    

### **Add or Modify a TXT Record**

1. **Type:** Select "TXT."
    
2. **Name:** Enter the subdomain or leave it empty for the root domain.
    
3. **Value:** Enter the required text data.
    
4. **TTL (Time to Live):** Choose the desired TTL value.
    
5. **Save/Update.**
    

### **Example Setup**

**Single TXT Record Example:**

```plaintext
example.com.    IN  TXT   "v=spf1 include:mail.example.com ~all"
```

**Multiple TXT Records Example:**

```plaintext
example.com.    IN  TXT   "v=spf1 include:mail.example.com ~all"
example.com.    IN  TXT   "google-site-verification=abc123xyz456"
```

### **Example Using Cloudflare**

1. **Access DNS Settings:**
    
    * Log in to Cloudflare and navigate to the DNS settings.
        
2. **Add a New TXT Record:**
    
    * **Type:** TXT
        
    * **Name:** Leave blank for the root domain or specify a subdomain (e.g., `_dmarc`).
        
    * **Content:** Enter the text data (e.g., `"v=spf1 include:`[`mail.example.com`](http://mail.example.com) `~all"`).
        
    * **TTL:** Auto
        
3. **Save Changes.**
    

## **4\. Best Practices for Using TXT Records**

### **Avoid Overloading**

* Avoid putting too much data into a single TXT record. Keep it concise and manageable.
    

### **Use Multiple Records**

* For different services like SPF and Google verification, use separate TXT records.
    

### **Monitor DNS Propagation**

* DNS changes may take 24-48 hours to propagate globally. Monitor propagation using online tools.
    

### **Regular Updates**

* Regularly update your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to ensure secure email delivery.
    

## **5\. Testing TXT Records**

### **Using** `dig` Command-Line Tool

The `dig` tool can help you verify your TXT records:

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 example.com TXT
```

* `@8.8.8.8`: Google's public DNS server
    
* [`example.com`](http://example.com): Domain name
    
* `TXT`: Record type
    

### **Sample Output**

```plaintext
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.    300   IN   TXT   "v=spf1 include:mail.example.com ~all"
example.com.    300   IN   TXT   "google-site-verification=abc123xyz456"
```

## **6\. Conclusion**

TXT records are versatile and essential for domain ownership verification, email security, and other configurations. Effectively managing them can improve your domain's reliability, security, and trustworthiness.
